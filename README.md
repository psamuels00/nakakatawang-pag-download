The Crazy Download

1. Find your way to the terminal prompt.

   One way is to press the Command key and Space bar at the same time, then type in "terminal.app" and press enter.
   Once you start typing "terminal.app", it should complete this for you.  Once the terminal starts, make sure you
   are at the prompt.  It will look something like this:

   ...whatever... $

   If you don't see the "$" at the end of the last line, then you are not at the prompt.

2. Go to your Downloads directory... Type in this command:

       cd ~/Downloads

3. Download the files...

       git clone https://github.com/psamuels00/nakakatawang-pag-download.git

4. Perform the installation...

       nakakatawang-pag-download/install.sh

   Drag 'TurboTax 2023.app' to the Applications folder, as instructed.

5. Cleanup.  Remove the installation files.
